HOWTO set up TileMap project

1. install GDAL
http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks#gdal_complete

2. Add GDAL to the PATH variable
Thanks for the tip to change the PATH! Just so we have this documented (in case we ever need to write it up),
this is command I added to .profile:
export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.6/Programs:$PATH

Then I reloaded the .profile:
. ./.profile

And I used echo to test the new path:
echo $PATH

I used this article for some pointers: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2621/os_x_change_path_environment_variable/
